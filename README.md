# ðŸš€C-Projects

<h3><b>ðŸŽ¯ I am going to upload all the basic projects in this repositori, I am gonna create in my c journey </b></h3>

<h3>1. Guess game ---></h3>

Loops(if-else) 

<h3>2. Simple calculator ---></h3> 

Conditional instruction and Loops( do-while, if-else, else-if ) are being used to create this program.

<h3>3.Password Strength Checker ---></h3>

Conditional instruction and Loops( do-while, if-else, else-if ) are being used to create this program.

<b>Approach ---</b>

1.consider factors such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.<br>
2.Input the password: Prompt the user to enter a password.<br>
3.Evaluate the password strength: Use conditional statements to check the password against the defined criteria.<br>
4.Assign a strength level: Based on the evaluation of the password against the criteria, assign a strength level such as weak, medium, or strong.<br>
5.Provide feedback: Print a message indicating the strength level of the password. You can also provide specific feedback on the criteria the password meets or fails to meet.

<h3>4.Grade Point Average (GPA) Calculator ---></h3>

Conditional instruction, Loops(for, if-else), Functions(getchar, toupper) are being used to create this program.

<b>Approach ---</b>

1.Prompt the user to enter the number of courses.<br>
2.For each course, prompt the user to enter the letter grade and credit hours.<br>
3.Assign grade points to each letter grade based on a standard grading scale:<br>
i) A: 4.0<br>
ii) B: 3.0<br>
iii) C: 2.0<br>
iv) D: 1.0<br>
v) F: 0.0<br>
4.Calculate the weighted sum of grade points by multiplying the grade points of each course by its corresponding credit hours.<br>
5.Calculate the total credit hours.<br>
6.Calculate the GPA by dividing the weighted sum of grade points by the total credit hours.<br>
7.Display the calculated GPA to the user.<br>

<h3>5.BMI Calculator ---></h3>

<b>Approach ---</b>

1.Prompt the user to enter their weight in kilograms.<br>
2.Prompt the user to enter their height in meters.<br>
3.Calculate the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height).<br>
4.Classify the BMI into different categories using the following guidelines:<br>
i) BMI less than 18.5: Underweight<br>
ii) BMI between 18.5 and 24.9: Normal weight<br>
iii) BMI between 25 and 29.9: Overweight<br>
iv) BMI 30 or greater: Obese<br>
5.Display the calculated BMI and the corresponding category to the user.<br>

<h3>6.Grade Management System ---></h3>

Conditional instruction, Loops(for, if-else) are being used to create this program.

<b>Approach ---</b>

1.Prompt the user to enter the number of students and the number of subjects.<br>
2.For each student, prompt the user to enter their marks for each subject.<br>
3.Calculate the average marks for each student.<br>
4.Determine the grade for each student based on their average marks using conditional instructions.<br>
5.Display the grades for each student.<br>

<h3>7.Simple ATM Simulator</h3>

Conditional instructions,loops(else-if)

<b>Approach ---</b>

1.Create a structure to represent an account with attributes such as account number, account holder name, and balance.<br>
2.Initialize the account with default values.<br>
3.Display a menu of operations for the user to choose from.<br>
4.Prompt the user to enter their choice.<br>
5.Based on the user's choice, use conditional instructions to perform the corresponding operation:<br>
a. Balance Inquiry: Display the current balance.<br>
b. Deposit: Prompt the user to enter the deposit amount and update the account balance.<br>
c. Withdrawal: Prompt the user to enter the withdrawal amount and update the account balance.<br>
d. Exit: Terminate the program.<br>
