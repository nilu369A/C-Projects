# 🚀C-Projects

<h3><b>🎯 I am going to upload all the basic projects in this repositori, I am gonna create in my c journey </b></h3>

<h3>1. Guess game ---></h3>

<h3>2. Simple calculator ---></h3> 

Conditional instruction and Loops( do-while, if-else, else-if ) are being used to create this program.

<h3>3.Password Strength Checker ---></h3>

Conditional instruction and Loops( do-while, if-else, else-if ) are being used to create this program.

<b>Approach ---</b>

1.consider factors such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.<br>
2.Input the password: Prompt the user to enter a password.<br>
3.Evaluate the password strength: Use conditional statements to check the password against the defined criteria. For example:<br>
i)Check the length of the password and determine if it meets a minimum length requirement.<br>
ii)Check if the password contains both uppercase and lowercase letters.<br>
iii)Check if the password includes numbers.<br>
iv)Check if the password includes special characters.<br>
4.Assign a strength level: Based on the evaluation of the password against the criteria, assign a strength level such as weak, medium, or strong.<br>
5.Provide feedback: Print a message indicating the strength level of the password. You can also provide specific feedback on the criteria the password meets or fails to meet.

<h3>4.Grade Point Average (GPA) Calculator ---></h3>

Conditional instruction, Loops(for, if-else), Functions(getchar, toupper) are being used to create this program.

<b>Approach ---</b>

1.Prompt the user to enter the number of courses.<br>
2.For each course, prompt the user to enter the letter grade and credit hours.<br>
3.Assign grade points to each letter grade based on a standard grading scale:<br>
i)A: 4.0<br>
ii)B: 3.0<br>
iii)C: 2.0<br>
iv)D: 1.0<br>
v)F: 0.0<br>
4.Calculate the weighted sum of grade points by multiplying the grade points of each course by its corresponding credit hours.<br>
5.Calculate the total credit hours.<br>
6.Calculate the GPA by dividing the weighted sum of grade points by the total credit hours.<br>
7.Display the calculated GPA to the user.<br>
