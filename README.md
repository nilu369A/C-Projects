<h3>1. Guess game ---></h3>

<h3>2. Simple calculator ---></h3> 

Conditional instruction and Loops( do-while, if-else, else-if ) are being used to create this program.

<h3>3.Password Strength Checker ---></h3>

Conditional instruction and Loops( do-while, if-else, else-if ) are being used to create this program.

<b>Approach ---</b>

1.consider factors such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.<br>
2.Input the password: Prompt the user to enter a password.<br>
3.Evaluate the password strength: Use conditional statements to check the password against the defined criteria. For example:<br>
i)Check the length of the password and determine if it meets a minimum length requirement.<br>
ii)Check if the password contains both uppercase and lowercase letters.<br>
iii)Check if the password includes numbers.<br>
iv)Check if the password includes special characters.<br>
4.Assign a strength level: Based on the evaluation of the password against the criteria, assign a strength level such as weak, medium, or strong.<br>
5.Provide feedback: Print a message indicating the strength level of the password. You can also provide specific feedback on the criteria the password meets or fails to meet.
